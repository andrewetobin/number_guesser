# Number Guesser


## Introduction and Function
User guesses a number between 0 and 100. Each time they guess they are told if they are too high or too low. They can guess 
again til they get the correct number. Then they can play again by clicking "Next Level" (which spreads min and max out by 10) 
or setting their own range.
